Why?

Death to C++ exceptions
Death to C++ iostream
Death to std::array
Death to std::move
Death to entire hosted C++

C++ standard library containers are completely usable since they are not freestanding.
No std::addressof but force exceptions? Are you kidding me?

Reporting allocation failure with exceptions is a huge annoying shit.

Design Goal

No exception nonsense
No RTTI nonsense
No iostream nonsense
Crash for fail fast
Freestanding aware
